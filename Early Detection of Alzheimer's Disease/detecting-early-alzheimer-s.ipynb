RELATED WORK\n","---\n","\n","The original publication has only done some preliminary exploration of the MRI data as majority of their work was focused towards data gathering. However, in the recent past there have been multiple efforts that have been made to detect early-alzheimers using MRI data. Some of the work that was found in the literature was as follows:\n","\n","1) **Machine learning framework for early MRI-based Alzheimer's conversion prediction in MCI subjects.** [3]\n","\n","   In this paper the authors were interested in identifying mild cognitive impairment(MCI) as a transitional stage between age-related coginitive decline and Alzheimer's. The group proposes a novel MRI-based biomaker that they developed using machine learning techniques. They used data available from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) Database. The paper claims that their aggregate biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.9020 in discriminating between progressive MCI (pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI).\n","   \n","   Noteworthy Techniques:\n","   1. Semi-supervised learning on data available from AD patients and normal controls, without using MCI patients, to help with the sMCI/pMCI classification. Performed feature selection using regularized logistic regression.\n","   2. They removed aging effects from MRI data before classifier training to prevent possible confounding between changes due to AD and those due to normal aging.\n","   3. Finally constructed an aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining age and cognitive measures about MCI subjects by applying a random foresst classifier.\n","\n","\n","2) **Detection of subjects and brain regions related to Alzheimer's disease using 3D MRI scans based on eigenbrain and machine learning.** [4] \n","    \n","    The authors of this paper have proposed a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for MRI images of brains based on eigenbrains [(eg.)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/138015/fncom-09-00066-HTML/image_m/fncom-09-00066-t010.jpg) and machine learning. In their approach they use key slices from the 3D volumetric data generated from the MRI and then generate eigenbrain images based on [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) data. They then used kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization. The accuracy of their polynomial kernel (92.36 $\\pm$ 0.94) was better than their linear (91.47 $\\pm$ 1.02) anf radial basis function (86.71 $\\pm$ 1.93) kernels.\n","\n","\n","3) **Support vector machine-based classification of Alzheimer’s disease from whole-brain anatomical MRI.** [5]\n","\n","    In this paper the authors propose a new method to discriminate patients with AD from elderly controls based on support vector machine (SVM) classification of whole-brain anatomical MRI. The authors used three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI images from 16 patients with AD and 22 elderly controls and parcellated them into regions of interests (ROIs). They then used a SVM algorithm to classify subjects based upon the gray matter characteristics of these ROIs. Based on their results the classifier obtained 94.5% mean correctness.\n","    \n","    The possible downfalls of their technique might be the fact that they haven't taken age related changes in the gray matter into account and they were working with a small data set.\n","    \n","    \n","We have described 3 papers over here that we found the most interesting, however there are a few more that have explored the same question. Regardless, it is worthwhile to mention that the above papers were exploring raw MRI data and we, on the other hand, are dealing with 3 to 4 biomarkers that are generated from MRI images."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"566105ab7a54c9420a4f649dea3fa1f52da1d79d","colab_type":"text","id":"XZY2wtKYtH3h"},"source":["# 4.
